# Research interests
My research focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-area of
artificial intelligence on agents that behaves nicely in complex environments.
Mainly, I am interested in learning behaviors by some more natural drivers
than hand-crafted rewards, such as curiosity, robustness, and communication.
So far, I have co-authored a few papers about generalization
and abstraction in RL.

# OSS Projects
I am a fan of OSS culture since I met the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community
during my undergraduate.
I have continuosly contributed to some OSS projects, although I am not very active now.
I received
[Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html)
for my contributions to [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

See my Github account for more.
