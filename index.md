# Research interests
I'm interested in the evolutionary simulation of virtual agents to get insights of real **brain evolution**.
Particularly, **reward function** is of my main interest.
From the age of early vertebrates (you can imagine fishes with eel-like mouth), reward function in our brains helped us survive in the world by providing learning signal to helpful events like food intake.
I'm doing simulation where many (100~500 so far) agents learn from their innate reward functions and observing how they evolve.

I did some deep reinforcement learning stuff in my masters and undergrad.

# Sub project?
- For evolutionary simulation with many agents, I made 2D physics simulator that works on GPU. Check [phyjax2d](https://github.com/kngwyu/phyjax2d) repo.

# OSS Projects
I am a fan of open sources and open communities since I met the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community during my undergraduate.
I have continuously contributed to some OSS projects, although I am not very active now.
I received [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html) for my contributions to [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

See my Github account for more.
